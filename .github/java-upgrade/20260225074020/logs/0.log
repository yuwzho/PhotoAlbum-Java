# Current Milestone Goal:
This is the 1st milestone, its goal is:
- upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.3.x*


# Next steps:
1. You **MUST!** identify all the dependencies or code that need upgrading to upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.3.x*, and make all necessary changes with any tools you prefer.
    - Here is some knowledge that you may leverage during the upgrade:
        - Apply OpenRewrite recipe `org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_3` in recipe lib `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:5.25.1` to make initial code changes for upgrading Spring Boot to 3.3 from any previous version.
    
2. You **MUST!** remember to invoke tool #build_java_project with sessionId "20260225074020" to validate the changes after performing the upgrade as any code change might introduce new build errors.

# Important Notes:
- You **MUST** fetch the contents first if guidelines are provided as links.
- You **MUST** ONLY upgrade the dependencies that are incompatible with the target version of Java/dependencies.
- You **MUST** ONLY make all necessary code changes to achieve the current milestone goal without any deviation whatsoever.
- You **MUST** strictly adhere to the current milestone goal but not the final upgrade goal.
- You **MUST** invoke tool #build_java_project to validate the changes regardless of how confident you are in your code changes. Even if:
    - You've already built the project before
    - You believe no new build errors could have been introduced
    - Previous checks showed no build errors
- You **MUST** maintain the exact same functionality/behavior logic when making any code changes. You **MUST NOT** change the original code functionality/behavior when making any code changes.
- "Guidelines" has higher priority than "Knowledge", so when there is any conflict between them, you **MUST** follow the guidelines.
- OpenRewrite recipes are preferable for upgrading dependencies and making code changes if applicable and provided as knowledge/guidelines.
    - You **MUST** use the JDK at "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10\bin" and the Maven at "C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\maven\apache-maven-3.9.11\bin" to apply OpenRewrite recipes, so be careful about the environment configuration before running terminal command to apply OpenRewrite recipes.
    - You should use `org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:5.47.3` (for Maven) or `org.openrewrite:plugin:6.28.3` (for Gradle) to apply OpenRewrite recipes if user didn't specify any version in the guidelines.
    - You **MUST** add "--quiet" parameter to the maven or gradle command when applying OpenRewrite recipes to avoid unnecessary output logs, the recipes are applied successfully as long as there is no error reported in the output.
    - You'd better use OpenRewrite YAML file (`rewrite.yml`) to configure all the necessary recipes to be applied, which then be referenced as active recipe by the `name` defined in the rewrite.yml when being applied. Remember to place the yaml file at the project root directory.
    - You **MUST** revert the OpenRewrite related configuration changes you made after applying the recipes to avoid polluting the project.

The upgrade plan at D:\code\ai\samples\repos\photo-album-java-fork\.github\java-upgrade\20260225074020\plan.md has been updated and confirmed.

# Confirmed final upgrade goal:
- upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.4.x*

## IMPORTANT NOTE: Milestone-based Upgrade

Given that this upgrade will span multiple version updates and the process is relatively complex, we believe that a milestone-based approach will make it easier to achieve the final goal. Therefore, we have divided the upgrade process into several smaller milestones and each milestone has its own smaller goal:
- Milestone 1: Upgrade project to use `Spring Boot 3.3.x`
- Milestone 2: Upgrade project to use `Spring Boot 3.4.x`

Now, let's start with the first milestone goal of upgrading the project.


# Current Milestone Goal:
This is the 1st milestone, its goal is:
- upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.3.x*


# Next steps:
1. You **MUST!** identify all the dependencies or code that need upgrading to upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.3.x*, and make all necessary changes with any tools you prefer.
    - Here is some knowledge that you may leverage during the upgrade:
        - Apply OpenRewrite recipe `org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_3` in recipe lib `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:5.25.1` to make initial code changes for upgrading Spring Boot to 3.3 from any previous version.
    
2. You **MUST!** remember to invoke tool #build_java_project with sessionId "20260225074020" to validate the changes after performing the upgrade as any code change might introduce new build errors.

# Important Notes:
- You **MUST** fetch the contents first if guidelines are provided as links.
- You **MUST** ONLY upgrade the dependencies that are incompatible with the target version of Java/dependencies.
- You **MUST** ONLY make all necessary code changes to achieve the current milestone goal without any deviation whatsoever.
- You **MUST** strictly adhere to the current milestone goal but not the final upgrade goal.
- You **MUST** invoke tool #build_java_project to validate the changes regardless of how confident you are in your code changes. Even if:
    - You've already built the project before
    - You believe no new build errors could have been introduced
    - Previous checks showed no build errors
- You **MUST** maintain the exact same functionality/behavior logic when making any code changes. You **MUST NOT** change the original code functionality/behavior when making any code changes.
- "Guidelines" has higher priority than "Knowledge", so when there is any conflict between them, you **MUST** follow the guidelines.

    - You should use `org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:5.47.3` (for Maven) or `org.openrewrite:plugin:6.28.3` (for Gradle) to apply OpenRewrite recipes if user didn't specify any version in the guidelines.
    - You **MUST** add "--quiet" parameter to the maven or gradle command when applying OpenRewrite recipes to avoid unnecessary output logs, the recipes are applied successfully as long as there is no error reported in the output.

# Important Notes:
- You MUST run this CVEs validation EVERY time you modifying any dependencies directly or indirectly to ensure no new CVE issues are introduced,
- You SHOULD NEVER skip CVE validation regardless of how confident you are in your code changes. Even if:
    - You've already checked these dependencies before
    - You believe no new vulnerabilities could have been introduced
    - No dependencies were explicitly changed in your recent modifications

Check the consistency between the current project state and the initial project state at commit 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb.
# Next steps:
1. You should get the file changes between current and initial commit 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb, you may use command 'git diff 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb HEAD' to get the changed codes.
2. Analyzing the code changes. Your primary responsibility is to ensure that **the functional behavior and semantics of the modified code remain consistent before and after the upgrade**.
You should follow below process to analyze and fix the code changes:
    1. **Hunk Identification**: Extract the hunk header (line starting with "@@") and its context
    2. **Original Code Analysis**:
       - Extract ALL lines starting with "-" (excluding the hunk header)
       - Document the EXACT functional purpose and behavior of the original code
       - Identify key variables, control flows, and outcomes
    3. **Modified Code Analysis**:
       - Extract ALL lines starting with "+" (excluding the hunk header)
       - Document the EXACT functional purpose and behavior of the modified code
       - Identify key variables, control flows, and outcomes
    4. **Behavioral Comparison**:
       - Compare ONLY the runtime behavior between original and modified code
       - Ignore syntactic differences that don't affect runtime behavior
       - Apply equivalent behavior test: "Given identical inputs, would both versions produce functionally equivalent outputs?"
    5. **Change Classification**:
       - First determine if there is a negative behavior change
       - If uncertain about impact, ALWAYS classify as "minor"
       - Only classify as "critical" or "major" when there is absolute certainty of significant negative impact
3. Fix any inconsistencies you find with major or critical severity in the code changes to ensure that the functional behavior and semantics of the modified code remain consistent before and after the upgrade.
4. Finally, after you confirm all issues has been addressed and there is no further action needed, you **MUST** call tool run_tests_for_java with parameter sessionId: 20260225074020 to continue the upgrade process.
## Definitions
- **Logic behavior** refers to what the code actually does functionally, not its syntax or style
- **Severity levels** are standardized as "critical", "major", or "minor" based on precise criteria. You MUST follow the following classifications rules:
    1. **Critical** - ONLY for changes that DEFINITELY cause data loss, introduce security vulnerabilities, or completely break core functionality
    2. **Major** - ONLY for changes that DEFINITELY alter program outcomes, remove important exception handling, or change core logic
    3. **Minor** - For ALL OTHER cases, including:
        - ALL cases where you are uncertain about the impact
        - ALL cases where you cannot determine the exact impact
        - ALL cases where evidence is insufficient to make a confident assessment
        - Changes that maintain functional equivalence but with slight implementation differences
## Handling Large Diffs
If the total diff is too large to process at once (exceeds context/window limits), you MUST follow this hierarchical strategy:
1. **Inventory Phase (No hunks yet)**:
   - Run: 'git diff --name-only 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb HEAD'
   - Categorize files: (a) source code, (b) configuration, (c) test code, (d) build scripts, (e) generated/mechanical.
   - Prioritize source + behavioral risk areas first (public APIs, domain logic, concurrency, I/O, security).
2. **File Selection Phase**:
   - For each selected file, first show ONLY a list of hunk headers using:
     'git diff -U0 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb HEAD -- <file>'
   - Summarize each hunk briefly (e.g., "Hunk 3: replaced loop with stream map/filter").
3. **State Tracking**:
   - Maintain an internal checklist of processed files/hunks.
   - DO NOT re-send previously analyzed hunks unless modified further.
   - Provide periodic status summaries: "Reviewed 8/24 hunks in 3/7 files; no major/critical changes so far."
# Important Notes:
- For every hunk, ALWAYS analyze and determine if there is a behavior change
- Apply severity classifications CONSISTENTLY using the defined criteria
- NEVER classify API changes that maintain functional equivalence as negative changes
- Use only "critical", "major", "minor" as severity levels, following the exact criteria defined
- You **MUST** call tool run_tests_for_java with parameter sessionId: 20260225074020 when you finish the consistency check and fixing.
- As the diff might be very large, you may split it into multiple parts and analyze them one by one or analyze the diff of each files.
- Always ignore changes that are necessary to successfully complete upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.4.x*. For example, 'javax' to 'jakarta' changes are necessary to successfully complete the upgrade to Jakarta EE.
- Always ignore error handling improvements that do not change the functional behavior of the code, such as adding more exception handling logic or adding more specific exception handling logic.
- Always ignore nullable changes that do not change the functional behavior of the code, such as adding more null checks or adding more validation logic.
- Always ignore changes from using 'String.format()' to 'formatted()' method on strings, which is a new feature since Java 15, as it does not change the functional behavior of the code.
- Always ignore the method name change from 'setURI' to 'setUri' reflects the new API, but the functionality should be the same assuming the new method properly sets the URI.
- Always ignore adding an error message to the 'Assert.isTrue()' call. This only affects test behavior and would make debugging test failures clearer.
- The property names have changed from DBCP to DBCP2. For example, the DataSource configuration used maxWait and maxActive properties from commons-dbcp, but now uses maxWaitMillis and maxTotal from commons-dbcp2. This is a necessary change to successfully complete the upgrade to commons-dbcp2.

2026-02-25T07:43:07.583Z [INFO] [Tool.invoke]({message: No known CVEs that need to be fixed are found for the given dependencies.
None or only minor severity code behavior changes are detected, which are not needed to be fixed. Please continue to validate test errors/failures.

        - ALL cases where you are uncertain about the impact
        - ALL cases where you cannot determine the exact impact
        - ALL cases where evidence is insufficient to make a confident assessment
        - Changes that maintain functional equivalence but with slight implementation differences
## Handling Large Diffs
If the total diff is too large to process at once (exceeds context/window limits), you MUST follow this hierarchical strategy:
1. **Inventory Phase (No hunks yet)**:
   - Run: 'git diff --name-only 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb HEAD'
   - Categorize files: (a) source code, (b) configuration, (c) test code, (d) build scripts, (e) generated/mechanical.
   - Prioritize source + behavioral risk areas first (public APIs, domain logic, concurrency, I/O, security).
2. **File Selection Phase**:
   - For each selected file, first show ONLY a list of hunk headers using:
     'git diff -U0 9e5e8ad6edbd9d2b8116394921eb23c087bdfaeb HEAD -- <file>'
   - Summarize each hunk briefly (e.g., "Hunk 3: replaced loop with stream map/filter").
3. **State Tracking**:
   - Maintain an internal checklist of processed files/hunks.
   - DO NOT re-send previously analyzed hunks unless modified further.
   - Provide periodic status summaries: "Reviewed 8/24 hunks in 3/7 files; no major/critical changes so far."
# Important Notes:
- For every hunk, ALWAYS analyze and determine if there is a behavior change
- Apply severity classifications CONSISTENTLY using the defined criteria
- NEVER classify API changes that maintain functional equivalence as negative changes
- Use only "critical", "major", "minor" as severity levels, following the exact criteria defined
- You **MUST** call tool run_tests_for_java with parameter sessionId: 20260225074020 when you finish the consistency check and fixing.
- As the diff might be very large, you may split it into multiple parts and analyze them one by one or analyze the diff of each files.
- Always ignore changes that are necessary to successfully complete upgrade `Spring Boot` to *3.4.x*. For example, 'javax' to 'jakarta' changes are necessary to successfully complete the upgrade to Jakarta EE.
- Always ignore error handling improvements that do not change the functional behavior of the code, such as adding more exception handling logic or adding more specific exception handling logic.
- Always ignore nullable changes that do not change the functional behavior of the code, such as adding more null checks or adding more validation logic.
- Always ignore changes from using 'String.format()' to 'formatted()' method on strings, which is a new feature since Java 15, as it does not change the functional behavior of the code.
- Always ignore the method name change from 'setURI' to 'setUri' reflects the new API, but the functionality should be the same assuming the new method properly sets the URI.
- Always ignore adding an error message to the 'Assert.isTrue()' call. This only affects test behavior and would make debugging test failures clearer.
- The property names have changed from DBCP to DBCP2. For example, the DataSource configuration used maxWait and maxActive properties from commons-dbcp, but now uses maxWaitMillis and maxTotal from commons-dbcp2. This is a necessary change to successfully complete the upgrade to commons-dbcp2.
